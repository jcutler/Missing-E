<a name="permissions"></a><p class="question">The Chrome Web Store (or other download page) has a lot of warnings about what 'Missing e' could do on my computer. Is it safe to install?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>Browser extensions need to ask for certain permissions from your browser in order for many features to work. Please read <a href="http://blog.missinge.infraware.ca/post/6005505122/permissions">this post on Tumblr</a> for an explanation of the permissions 'Missing e' uses and why.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Safari</strong></p>
<ul><li>Download the extension <a href="http://missinge.infraware.ca/safari/missinge.safariextz">here</a>. When it asks you to "Open" or "Save" the file, choose "Open", then click "Install".</li>
<li>If you are never presented with the option to "Open" the file, check your "Downloads" window. Find the file <em>missinge.safariextz</em>, right-click (Ctrl+click on Mac) on it and hit "Open", then "Install".</li></ul>

<a name="askfixes-on"></a><p class="question">How do I add tags when I answer a message (ask)?</p>
<div class="response"><p>Tagging of messages (asks) when you answer them, part of the <em>Ask Fixes</em> feature is <strong>disabled by default</strong> when you first 'Install Missing e' or update to version 1.2.1+. To enable it, you need to go to the settings page (<a href="#settings">find out how</a>) and enable it under the <em>Social Features</em> tab, in the <em>Ask Fixes</em> section.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="reblog-tags"></a><p class="question">Why does 'Missing e' change the look of the reblog button on post pages?</p>
<div class="response"><p>The <em>Better Reblogs</em> feature can automatically keep the tags from a post when you reblog it. To support this on individual post pages, <em>Better Reblogs</em> must get the tags from the Tumblr API. When it does so successfully, the reblog button changes to what you see below to indicate that the tags will be preserved when you reblog.</p>
<div class="example"><img src="images/examples/reblog_tags.png" alt="Reblog with Tags button" /><div class="caption">Reblog (with tags) button</div></div>
<p>During times when Tumblr is very busy or error-prone, the API may not work correctly. <em>Better Reblogs</em> will retry a few times before giving up. When that happens, the reblog button will change to the button below. You can still click on it to reblog the post, but the tags will not be added automatically.</p>
<div class="example"><img src="images/examples/reblog_tags_fail.png" alt="Reblog with Tags (failed) button" /><div class="caption">Reblog with tags (failed) button</div></div>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="no-reblog-tags"></a><p class="question">I don't want my reblogs to include tags from the original post. How can I turn that feature off?</p>
<div class="response"><p>The <em>Better Reblogs</em> feature can add tags from the original post when reblogging. You can turn it off completely in the settings (which you can access <a href="http://missinge.infraware.ca/faq#settings">like this</a>), under the <em>Post Features</em> tab, in the <em>Better Reblogs</em> section.</p>
<p><strong>You Can:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Turn off reblogging tags completely<ul><li><small>Do this by turning off the checkbox labelled: <em>"Keep original post tags when reblogging"</em></small></li></ul></li>
<li>Disable automatic adding of original post tags<ul><li><small>You will still be able to manually add the original post tags with the <em>"Reblog Tags"</em> button</small></li></ul></li></ul>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="quick-reblog-on"></a><p class="question">How do I turn on quick (1-click) reblogging?</p>
<div class="response"><p>Quick (1-clicking) reblogging, part of the <em>Better Reblogs</em> feature, is <strong>disabled by default</strong> when you first install 'Missing e' or update to version 1.1.0+. To enable it, you need to go to the settings page (<a href="#settings">find out how</a>) and enable it under the <em>Post Features</em> tab, in the <em>Better Reblogs</em> section.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="quickreblog-account"></a><p class="question">I want quick (1-click) reblogging to post to one of my secondary Tumblr accounts. How can I do that?</p>
<div class="response"><p>In the 'Missing e' settings page (<a href="#settings">find out how to get there</a>), under the <em>Post Features</em> tab, in the <em>Better Reblogs</em> section, you can choose the Tumblr blog you want to use quick reblogging with.</p>
<p>In these settings, either choose <strong>Main Blog</strong> or <strong>Secondary Blog</strong> and specify an account name. Remember that you <em>must have posting rights</em> on the account you specify or quick (1-click) reblogging will always fail.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="bookmark-follow"></a><p class="question">Why does the bookmark icon not appear on some posts?</p>
<div class="response"><p>The <em>Bookmarker</em> feature allows you to jump directly to a post in your dashboard without having to scroll all the way there yourself. As such, you are only able to bookmark posts by Tumblrs that you follow. These posts (which you will usually on tag search result pages like '<em>http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/sometag</em>') will not have a <em>Bookmarker</em> icon that you can click on.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="bookmark-issue"></a><p class="question">Why does loading a bookmarked post sometimes loads the dash at the wrong post or the post immediately before the correct one?</p>
<div class="response"><p>Some blogs (especially secondary tumblrs) do not behave correctly on your Tumblr dashboard. They may appear in your feed for a time, but after a while you may no longer be able to scroll to them. The posts are still visible on the Tumblr's personal page, but not on the dashboard.</p><p>Both <em>Bookmarker</em> and <em>Goto Dash Post</em> may instead bring you to the next earliest post by someone that you follow.</p><div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="bookmark-format"></a><p class="question">How do I change the default bookmark labels to the 12-hour format instead of 24-hour?</p>
<p class="question">How do I change the way the date and time is shown in default bookmark labels?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>In the settings (which you can access <a href="#settings">like this</a>), you can change the default format of how the date and time will appear on bookmark labelss. By default, the format will be <strong>%Y-%m-%D %H:%i</strong>, which would look like <strong>2011-04-09 23:07</strong>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of these "special sequences" that you can use, all of them conveniently listed on the settings page. For example, if you wanted that same timestamp to show up as <strong>missing-e: 9-Apr-2011 11:07pm</strong> (for a bookmarked post written by Tumblr <em>"missing-e"</em>, you would enter the format as <strong>%u: %d-%M-%Y %g:%i%a</strong>.
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="rename-bookmark"></a><p class="question">How do I change the name of a bookmark to something more useful?</p>
<div class="response">
<p class="singleline"><strong>You can set a custom name for a bookmark when you create it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hold down the <img class="inlineimg" src="images/shift.gif" alt="Shift" /> key when you click on the bookmark icon <img class="inlineimg" src="images/bookmark_icon.png" alt="Bookmark icon" style="vertical-align:middle;" /> of a post.</li>
<li>A popup box will appear for you to write in the custom bookmark name.</li>
</ul>
<p class="singleline"><strong>You can also change the name of an existing bookmark:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hold down the <img class="inlineimg" src="images/shift.gif" alt="Shift" /> key when you click on a bookmark in the list in your dashboard sidebar.</li>
<li>The link will change to an input where you can type in the custom name.</li>
<li>If you decide not to change the name, just press the <img class="inlineimg" src="images/esc.gif" alt="Esc" /> key.</li>

</div>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="scroll"></a><p class="question">What are the <em>endless scroll</em> "prevent stalling" and "timeout" options for?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>The Tumblr dashboard has an "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" feature that automatically loads the next page of posts for you when you get to the bottom of the dashboard.</p>
<div class="example">
<img src="images/examples/scroll_loading.png" alt="Endless Scroll loading" />
<div class="caption">"<strong>Endless Scroll</strong>" loading a new page of posts</div>
</div>
<p>Normally, if an "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" load fails, it should try a second time. If it fails again, it should say it has failed and a display a "Try again" button you can click on to force it to retry.</p>
<div class="example">
<img src="images/examples/scroll_failed.png" alt="Endless Scroll failed" />
<div class="caption">"<strong>Endless Scroll</strong>" fails</div>
</div>
<p>There are two shortcomings with the "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" feature that <em>Dashboard Fixes</em> can improve:</p>
<p class="singleline"><strong>1. There is no timeout</strong></p>
<ul><li>If a load stalls for a long time, Tumblr's "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" feature will just keep waiting, possibly indefinitely.</li></ul>
<p>The 'Missing e' <em>Dashboard Fixes</em> feature will force loads that are taking too long to stop, allowing you to try again. In the settings (which you can access <a href="#settings">like this</a>) you can specify how long you want that timeout to be. After waiting one timeout length, it will force "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" to try again. After another timeout length, it will give up and display the "Try again" button.</p>
<p>For example, if the timeout is set to 15 seconds, Tumblr will try to load the next page once, give up after 15 seconds, try again, give up again after 15 seconds and then display the "Try again" button.</p>
<p>Don't set the timeout to <em>too short a length</em>, or it may cause loads that would have succeeded to stop early!</p>
<div class="example">
<img src="images/examples/tumbeasts.jpg" alt="Tumblr error page" />
<div class="caption">Tumblr error page</div>
</div>
<p class="singleline"><strong>2. Tumblr Error Pages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When Tumblr's servers are overloaded, they sometimes display an error page instead of content.</li>
<li>The "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" feature will sometimes also receive this error page when it tries to load the next page, <em>only it doesn't know what to do with it</em> and <em><strong>won't even try again!</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Dashboard Fixes</em> will resolve this situation by forcing the next page load to restart or display the "Try again" button.</p>

<p><strong>You can:</strong></p>

<p>Unlike Chrome and Firefox, Safari will, by default, load any link that requests a new window in a new window instead of a new tab. You can change this behaviour in Safari's preferences: in the "<em>Tabs</em>" section, change the setting "<em>Open pages in tabs instead of windows</em>" to "<strong>Automatically</strong>".</p>

<a name="followchecker-fail"></a><p class="question">Why does Follow Checker fail to load?</p>
<div class="response">
<p><em>Follow Checker</em> must load every single one of your follower AND following pages behind the scenes. This can take a while, especially if you follow or are followed by a lot of tumblr accounts. During times when Tumblr is very busy or error-prone, one or more of these pages may fail to load. <em>Follow Checker</em> will retry a few times before giving up and returning an error screen.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>Unfortunately, Tumblr often does not show all of your followers or accounts you follow on the follower/following pages. Some may be missing from one or both of these lists.</p><p><em>Follow Checker</em> presents information purely for entertainment purposes.

<div class="response">
<p>The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho">Greek letter <strong>&rho;</strong> (rho)</a> is used in statistics to represent the coefficient of correlation between two or more random variables. It is used in <em>Follow Checker</em> to refer to the relationship of tumblrs you follow to tumblrs that follow you.</p>

<a name="goto-issue"></a><p class="question">Why does clicking on the "Goto Dash" icon of some posts bring me to the wrong post on the dashboard, or the post immediately before the correct one?</p>
<div class="response"><p>Some blogs (especially secondary tumblrs) do not behave correctly on your Tumblr dashboard. They may appear in your feed for a time, but after a while you may no longer be able to scroll to them. The posts are still visible on the Tumblr's personal page, but not on the dashboard.</p><p>Both <em>Bookmarker</em> and <em>Goto Dash Post</em> may instead bring you to the next earliest post by someone that you follow.</p>

<p>Much like the '+ Upload Photo' button that Tumblr places on new text post pages by default, <em>Posting Fixes</em> must load an additional Tumblr page in the background before adding the button.

<p class="question">How do I change the way the date and time is shown in timestamps?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>In the settings (which you can access <a href="#settings">like this</a>), you can change the format of how the date and time will appear on post timestamps. By default, the format will be <strong>%Y-%m-%D %H:%i</strong>, which would look like <strong>2011-04-09 23:07</strong>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of these "special sequences" that you can use, all of them conveniently listed on the settings page. For example, if you wanted that same timestamp to show up as <strong>9-Apr-2011 11:07pm</strong>, you would enter the format as <strong>%d-%M-%Y %g:%i%a</strong>.

<p><em>Timestamps</em> uses the Tumblr API to get the time of a post. Unfortunately, Tumblr is known to sometimes report the time of a post incorrectly, often several hours after it was actually posted. For posts where Tumblr is incorrect, <em>Timestamps</em> will also be incorrect.</p>

<p>You can use <em>Unfollower</em> by clicking on the <strong>&Delta;</strong> (Greek letter delta) symbol beside your follower count in the sidebar on your tumblelog page (ie. <em>http://www.tumblr.com/tumblelog/<strong>yourusername</strong></em>). The <strong>&Delta;</strong> is hidden until you place your mouse on or next to your follower count.</p>
<p>Note that <em>Unfollower</em> cannot tell the difference between Tumblr accounts that have unfollowed you, been deleted, or <strong>been renamed</strong>. You should also note that <em>Unfollower</em> will only show the difference since the last time you used <em>Unfollower</em> (or since you installed 'Missing e', if you have not used it).

<p>First of all, <em>Unfollower</em> displays all tumblr accounts that have either unfollowed you, been deactivated or have changed usernames. It cannot determine the difference in these situations. In addition, <em>Unfollower</em> can only show you who has unfollowed since you last checked (or since you first opened Tumblr after installing 'Missing e' if you haven't checked yet). If somebody follows you and unfollows you in the meantime, <em>Unfollower</em> will be not be able to report that to you.</p><p>Also, Tumblr, unfortunately, often does not show all of your followers on the follower pages.

<p>The <em>"Allow replies to reblogs"</em> option does, indeed, allow you to reply to reblogged posts with a button that looks like <strong>[reply]</strong> <em>or</em> <span class="MissingE_post_control MissingE_experimental_reply_control" style="margin-left:0px;"></span>. If the user who reblogged it has their "Show notifications" setting turned on in their Tumblr <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/preferences">preferences</a>, they will <em>most likely</em> receive a notification of your reply. However, your reply <em>may not</em> always show up in the post's notes. Especially if you have also reblogged it, or reblog it after replying.</p>
<p>On top of that, the attempt to reply may not even work at all! When attempting to send a reply, the experimental reply button will be replaced with an <span class="MissingE_post_control MissingE_experimental_reply_success" style="margin-left:0px;"></span> icon, if successful. If the reply fails for some reason, you will see an <span class="MissingE_post_control MissingE_experimental_reply_fail" style="margin-left:0px;"></span> icon.</p>
